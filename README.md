**WP GuardMaster** is a feature-rich, conceptual WordPress security plugin developed as an educational pet project. It demonstrates core principles of web application security, specifically within the WordPress ecosystem, by implementing several essential hardening and monitoring features.

This project is created by **Ivan Piskunov** for educational demonstration, to illustrate security concepts for students and to serve as a learning tool for secure WordPress development practices.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer: This is NOT a production-ready security solution.**
> This plugin was developed for **educational and self-learning purposes only**. It is intended to demonstrate security concepts and should not be relied upon to protect live websites. Always use professionally developed and maintained security solutions for any production environment.

## üöÄ Project Goals

*   **Educational Tool:** To serve as a practical example for students and developers learning about WordPress plugin development and web application security (OWASP Top 10 principles) .
*   **Concept Demonstration:** To demonstrate how key security features (like brute force protection, monitoring, and hardening) can be implemented structurally in WordPress.
*   **Best Practices Showcase:** To illustrate coding standards, WordPress hooks, and security-aware development practices within the WordPress plugin architecture .

## ‚ú® Features

WP GuardMaster implements several foundational security features:

*   **Brute Force Login Protection:** Limits failed login attempts from a single IP address using WordPress Transients API to temporarily block malicious actors .
*   **Email Notifications:** Alerts the site administrator via email upon events like IP lockout and successful admin logins (for oversight).
*   **Backup Monitoring:** Checks for the existence and freshness of backup files in a specified directory and sends warnings if backups are outdated or missing.
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):** (Planned feature) Adds an extra layer of security to the WordPress login process for administrators, a highly recommended practice .
*   **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):** (Basic Implementation) Scans core WordPress files for unauthorized modifications by comparing against known hashes.
*   **WordPress Version Hiding:** Removes the WordPress version number from generated pages and feeds to reduce the attack surface (security through obscurity).

## üî¨ Learning Resources & Best Practices

This project draws inspiration from and aims to adhere to security best practices outlined by authoritative sources:

*   **OWASP Top 10:** A standard awareness document for web application security risks. WP GuardMaster touches on A02 (Cryptographic Failures - via 2FA), A05 (Security Misconfiguration), and A07 (Identification and Authentication Failures) .
*   **WordPress Developer Handbook: Security:** The official guide to writing secure WordPress code, covering data validation, escaping, and nonces .
*   **WordPress Hardening:** The WordPress.org team's guide to securing your WordPress installation.

## üèÜ Inspiration & Industry Standards

This educational project was inspired by and aims to emulate the core concepts behind professional, industry-leading WordPress security plugins such as:

*   **[Wordfence Security](https://www.wordfence.com/):** Renowned for its robust endpoint firewall and malware scanner. It's a prime example of a comprehensive, all-in-one security solution for WordPress .
*   **[Sucuri Security](https://sucuri.net/):** Known for its powerful website firewall (WAF), incident response, and malware cleanup services. It exemplifies the DNS-level firewall approach .
*   **All In One WP Security & Firewall:** A strong free plugin that uses a points-based grading system to help users improve their site's security posture, much like the conceptual approach here .

## ü§ù Contributing

As this is primarily a personal educational project, large-scale contributions are not expected. However, constructive feedback, suggestions for improving code clarity for educational purposes, or fixes for glaring issues are welcome through GitHub Issues and Pull Requests. Please ensure any code follows WordPress coding standards and security best practices.
