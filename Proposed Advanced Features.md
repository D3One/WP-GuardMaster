## ðŸš€ Proposed Advanced Features

1.  **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):**
    *   **Implementation:** Use the PHP library `robthree/twofactorauth` (via Composer) to generate TOTP secrets. Users enroll by scanning a QR code in an app like Google Authenticator.
    *   **Process:** Hook into `authenticate` filter. After username/password is validated, check for a valid TOTP code via a custom form. The `templates/2fa-form.php` and `assets/js/2fa.js` would handle the UX.

2.  **File Integrity Monitoring (FIM):**
    *   **Implementation:** On activation, fetch the official checksums for the installed WordPress version from the WordPress API (`api.wordpress.org/core/checksums/1.0/`). Store them. During a cron job, scan core files (`wp-admin/`, `wp-includes/`) and compare hashes (`md5_file()`). Report discrepancies.
    *   **Best Practice:** This is a cornerstone of system hardening, as recommended by [SANS](https://www.sans.org/blog/file-integrity-monitoring-why-you-need-it/) and [CIS](https://www.cisecurity.org/cis-benchmarks/).

3.  **Security Headers:**
    *   **Easy Win:** Add an option to output headers like `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS), and `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` using the `send_headers` hook. Use the [Security Headers](https://securityheaders.com/) tool to test. Guidance can be found on [OWASP's Secure Headers Project](https://owasp.org/www-project-secure-headers/).
